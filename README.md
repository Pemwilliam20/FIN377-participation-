# FIN377-participation-Pemwilliam20

Hello! :) 

This repo serves as an index of my participation over the course of the semester. 

It contains four core components in the form of folders:

- codebook
  - contains my personal python cheatsheet! 
- homework
  - consists of the after class practice exercises! 
- livecoding 
  - consists of all of the in-class exercises we did! 
- misc 
  - contains whatever I'd like to include! 

The repo also has a navigating github directory as well: 
- That provides some detail regarding you can guess...navigating github! 


Hope you enjoy the visit :clap:
